Color Doppler Echocardiography
An accurate & non-invasive assessment of the overall health of the heart with ultrasound. A transducer is placed on the chest wall of a patient and cardiovascular images are taken. Ventricular squeezing/relaxing & valve opening/closing motions in rhythm with heartbeat can be evaluated for abnormalities.
