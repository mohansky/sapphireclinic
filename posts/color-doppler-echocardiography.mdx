Color Doppler Echocardiography
An accurate & non-invasive assessment of the overall health of the heart with ultrasound. A transducer is placed on the chest wall of a patient and cardiovascular images are taken. Ventricular squeezing/relaxing & valve opening/closing motions in rhythm with heartbeat can be evaluated for abnormalities.

#### Added info 

An echocardiogram is a noninvasive (the skin is not pierced) procedure used to assess the heart's function and structures. During the procedure, a transducer (like a microphone) sends out sound waves at a frequency too high to be heard. When the transducer is placed on the chest at certain locations and angles, the sound waves move through the skin and other body tissues to the heart tissues, where the waves bounce or "echo" off of the heart structures. These sound waves are sent to a computer that can create moving images of the heart walls and valves.

An echocardiogram may use several special types of echocardiography, as listed below:
- M-mode echocardiography. This, the simplest type of echocardiography, produces an image that is similar to a tracing rather than an actual picture of heart structures. M-mode echo is useful for measuring or viewing heart structures, such as the heart's pumping chambers, the size of the heart itself, and the thickness of the heart walls.
- Doppler echocardiography. This Doppler technique is used to measure and assess the flow of blood through the heart's chambers and valves. The amount of blood pumped out with each beat is an indication of the heart's functioning. Also, Doppler can detect abnormal blood flow within the heart, which can indicate a problem with one or more of the heart's four valves, or with the heart's walls.
- Color Doppler. Color Doppler is an enhanced form of Doppler echocardiography. With color Doppler, different colors are used to designate the direction of blood flow. This simplifies the interpretation of the Doppler technique.
- 2-D (two-dimensional) echocardiography. This technique is used to "see" the actual motion of the heart structures. A 2-D echo view appears cone-shaped on the monitor, and the real-time motion of the heart's structures can be observed. This enables the doctor to see the various heart structures at work and evaluate them.
- 3-D (three-dimensional) echocardiography. 3-D echo technique captures three-dimensional views of the heart structures with greater detail than 2-D echo. The live or "real time" images allow for a more accurate assessment of heart function by using measurements taken while the heart is beating. 3-D echo shows enhanced views of the heart's anatomy and can be used to determine the appropriate plan of treatment for a person with heart disease.

#### How do I get ready for an echocardiogram?

- Your doctor will explain the procedure to you and ask if you have any questions.
- Generally, you don't need to do any preparation such as fasting or having sedation.
- Tell your doctor of all prescription and over-the-counter medicines and herbal supplements that you are taking.
- Tell your doctor if you have a pacemaker.
- Based on your medical condition, your doctor may request other specific preparation.
