Holter monitor is a portable device for continuously monitoring various electrical activity of the cardiovascular system for at least 24 hours. The Holter's most common use is for monitoring heart activity (electrocardiography or ECG).


The Holter monitor is a type of portable electrocardiogram (ECG). It records the electrical activity of the heart continuously over 24 hours or longer while you are away from the doctor's office. A standard or "resting" ECG is one of the simplest and fastest tests used to evaluate the heart. Electrodes (small, plastic patches that stick to the skin) are placed at certain points on the chest and abdomen. The electrodes are connected to an ECG machine by wires. Then, the electrical activity of the heart can be measured, recorded, and printed. No electricity is sent into the body.

Natural electrical impulses coordinate contractions of the different parts of the heart. This keeps blood flowing the way it should. An ECG records these impulses to show how fast the heart is beating, the rhythm of the heart beats (steady or irregular), and the strength and timing of the electrical impulses. Changes in an ECG can be a sign of many heart-related conditions.


#### Why might I need a Holter monitor?

Some reasons for your healthcare provider to request a Holter monitor recording or event monitor recording include:

- To evaluate chest pain that can't be reproduced with exercise testing
- To evaluate other signs and symptoms that may be heart-related, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting
- To identify irregular heartbeats or palpitations
- To assess risk for future heart-related events in certain conditions, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (thickened heart walls), after a heart attack that caused weakness of the left side of the heart, or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (where an abnormal electrical conduction pathway exists within the heart)
- To see how well a pacemaker is working
- To determine how well treatment for complex arrhythmias is working

There may be other reasons for your healthcare provider to recommend the use of a Holter monitor.

#### How do I get ready for a Holter monitor?

- Your healthcare provider will explain the procedure to you and you can ask questions.
- You do not need to fast (not eat or drink).
- Based on your medical condition, your healthcare provider may request other specific preparation.
