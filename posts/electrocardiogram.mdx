An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is done to: Check the heart's electrical activity; Find the cause of unexplained chest pain, which could be caused by a heart attack, inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart; and Find the cause of symptoms of heart disease, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, or rapid, irregular heartbeats.


#### Added info 

An electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the simplest and fastest tests used to evaluate the heart. Electrodes (small, plastic patches that stick to the skin) are placed at certain spots on the chest, arms, and legs. The electrodes are connected to an ECG machine by lead wires. The electrical activity of the heart is then measured, interpreted, and printed out. No electricity is sent into the body.
<br/>
Natural electrical impulses coordinate contractions of the different parts of the heart to keep blood flowing the way it should. An ECG records these impulses to show how fast the heart is beating, the rhythm of the heart beats (steady or irregular), and the strength and timing of the electrical impulses as they move through the different parts of the heart. Changes in an ECG can be a sign of many heart-related conditions.
<br/>
Some reasons for your doctor to request an electrocardiogram (ECG) include:

- To look for the cause of chest pain
- To evaluate problems which may be heart-related, such as severe tiredness, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting
- To identify irregular heartbeats
- To help determine the overall health of the heart before procedures such as surgery; or after treatment for conditions such as a heart attack (myocardial infarction, or MI), endocarditis (inflammation or infection of one or more of the heart valves); or after heart surgery or cardiac catheterization
- To see how an implanted pacemaker is working
- To determine how well certain heart medicines are working
- To get a baseline tracing of the heart's function during a physical exam; this may be used as a comparison with future ECGs, to determine if there have been any changes
<br/>
There may be other reasons for your doctor to recommend an ECG.

#### How do I get ready for an electrocardiogram?

- Your doctor or the technician will explain the test to you and let you ask questions.
- Generally, fasting (not eating) is not required before the test.
- Tell your doctor of all medicines (prescribed and over-the-counter), vitamins, herbs, and supplements that you are taking.
- Tell your doctor if you have a pacemaker.
- Based on your medical condition, your doctor may request other specific preparation.
