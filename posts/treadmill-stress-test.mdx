Cardiovascular exercise stress testing in conjunction with an ECG has been established as one of the focal points in the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular disease, specifically coronary artery disease.


#### Added info 

A stress test shows how the heart works during physical activity. It also may be called a stress exercise test. Exercise makes the heart pump harder and faster. A stress test can show problems with blood flow within the heart.

A stress test usually involves walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike. A health care provider watches your heart rhythm, blood pressure and breathing during the test. People who can't exercise may be given a medicine that creates the effects of exercise.

Your health care provider may recommend a stress test if you have symptoms of coronary artery disease or an irregular heart rhythm, called an arrhythmia.

A stress test can help:

- Guide treatment decisions.
- Show how well heart treatment is working.
- Show how serious a heart condition is.




#### Why it's done

A health care provider may recommend a stress test to:
 <div className="grid grid-cols-2 bg-slate-200">
- Diagnose coronary artery disease. The coronary arteries are the major blood vessels that bring blood and oxygen to the heart. Coronary artery disease develops when these arteries get damaged or diseased. Cholesterol deposits in the heart arteries and inflammation usually cause coronary artery disease.
- Diagnose heart rhythm problems. A heart rhythm problem is called an arrhythmia. An arrhythmia can cause the heart to beat too fast or too slowly.
- Guide treatment of heart disorders. If you've already been diagnosed with a heart condition, an exercise stress test can help your provider know if your treatment is working. The test results also help your provider decide on the best treatment for you.
- Check the heart before surgery. A stress test can help show if surgery, such as a valve replacement or a heart transplant, might be a safe treatment.

If an exercise stress test doesn't show the cause of symptoms, your provider may recommend a stress test with imaging. Such tests include a nuclear stress test or stress test with an echocardiogram.


#### How you prepare

Your health care provider can tell you how to prepare for your stress test.
Food and medicine

You may be asked not to eat, drink or smoke for a time before a stress test. You may need to stay away from caffeine the day before and the day of the test.

Some medicines might have an effect on stress tests. Ask your health care provider if you can take your medicines before the test.

If you use an inhaler for asthma or other breathing problems, bring it to the test. Tell your health care providers that you use an inhaler.
Clothing and personal items

Wear or bring comfortable clothes and walking shoes.
